  description: "Tasks - Each FFCS member can make a repository on their GitHub titled DAC Task Submissions and upload their solutions there itself.These will be considered for your FFCS evaluation, including the date of submission. So please submit things on time. The solutions in you're repository will be 50% of your evaluation, and the tasks given to you when you join various teams would account for 50%. The deadline for the first two tasks is next Wednesday so please upload your solutions by then. We understand that a lot of you might be having COVID/have friends or family with COVID. It is a difficult time for us. But we are a technical club and we have to be answerable to Student Welfare when they ask us about evaluation criteria etc. Stay home, stay safe and try our best, that's all we can do. If for some reason you're unable to submit, feel free to DM me @Ashwin Iyer or @Mihir Gupta Dac personally."
